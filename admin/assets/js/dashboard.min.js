	Linking Mura CMS statically or dynamically with other modules constitutes the preparation of a derivative work based on

	In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Mura CMS grant you permission to combine Mura CMS with 
	independent software modules (plugins, themes and bundles), and to distribute these plugins, themes and bundles without

	Your custom code 
	
	• Must not alter any default objects in the Mura CMS database and

	/admin/

	You may copy and distribute Mura CMS with a plug-in, theme or bundle that meets the above guidelines as a combined work
